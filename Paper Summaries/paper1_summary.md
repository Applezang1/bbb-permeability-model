## Key Terminology for Contextual Understanding: 

<ins>SMILES</ins>: representation of chemical structure as a line of text and symbols
<ins>Pandas DataFrames</ins>: a 2-dimensional data structure where each column can hold different types of data (integer, string, float) 
<ins>PubChem CID</ins>: a unique number that is associated with a unique chemical compound stored in the PubChem Compound Database 
<ins>RdKit</ins>: an open-source cheminformatics library that allows you to find information related to molecules 
<ins>Isomeric SMILES</ins>: a type of SMILES that represents bonds between different elements as well as their stereochemical and isotopic information
<ins>Canonical SMILES</ins>:  a type of SMILES that represents bonds between different elements
<ins>stereochemical</ins>: the 3D arrangement of atoms
<ins>InChI (International Chemical Identifier)</ins>: a unique representation of chemical structure as a line of text and symbols that is longer than SMILES but contains stereochemical and isometric information
<ins>logBB threshold value</ins>: a determinant value that determines whether a drug is permeable (above threshold) or not permeable to the BBB (below threshold)
<ins>IUPAC name</ins>: a readable representation of a certain chemical molecule intended to be used as the vocabulary for scientific works
