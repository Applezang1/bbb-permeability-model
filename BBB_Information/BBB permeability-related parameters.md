# BBB Permeability-Related Parameters 
## LogBB (BB: Permeability of blood brain barrier) 
<ins>Definition</ins>: log[base 10] (drug concentration in brain/drug concentration in blood)

<ins>Function</ins>: Measures the drug concentration in the brain in comparison to the drug concentration in the blood 

<ins>Result Interpretation</ins>: Positive number means there’s more drugs in the brain, negative number means there’s more drugs in the blood

## LogP (P: Partion Coefficient) 
<ins>Definiton</ins>: log[base 10] (drug in octanol/drug in water) (octanol: fatty-nonpolar liquid mimicking a real-life membrane used to obtain logP value) 

<ins>Function</ins>: Measures the lipophilicity (affinity towards lipids) of the drug

<ins>Result Interpretation</ins>: Higher LogP value means greater lipophilicity of the substance 

<ins>Note</ins>: Ideal LogP value for high blood brain barrier permeability: 2-5.This is because drugs need to be hydrophobic to pass through the endothelial membrane while being hydrophilic enough to dissolve into the blood. 

## LogPS (PS: Permeability Surface Area)
<ins>Definition</ins>: log[base 10] (permeability * surface area available for diffusion) 

<ins>Function</ins>: Measures the rate of drug entry into the brain as a result of the membrane’s permeability and the amount of surface area available for diffusion 

<ins>Result Interpretation</ins>: Higher numbers means higher rate of entry into the brain
