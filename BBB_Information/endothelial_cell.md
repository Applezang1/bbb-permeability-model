# Endothelial Cells
<ins>Endothelial Cells</ins>: Specific endothelial cells found in the brain with special properties and structures that make up the BBB and surround the capillaries near the brain.

## Endothelial Membrane Composition: 
### Efflux Pump
<ins>Efflux Pump</ins> (primarily P-glycoprotein): special proteins located on the endothelial membrane whose primary function is to pump out substances (such as drugs, toxins, …) back into the capillary. It recognizes substances to pump out based on a specific property or shape.

### Lipid Bilayer Property 
<ins>Properties of the Lipid Bilayer</ins>: The endothelial membrane is a double lipid-bilayer (universal throughout all membranes in all types of cells). Lipids are tightly-packed together which prevents big molecules from entering the membrane. In addition, the lipid’s hydrophobic property prevents hydrophilic molecules from bypassing the membrane. Therefore, the lipid bilayer only allows small, hydrophobic molecules to diffuse through its membrane and other hydrophilic or big molecules need to enter the cell through membrane proteins.

### Active, Passive Transport Proteins 
<ins>Active and Passive Transport Proteins</ins>: Membrane proteins that are responsible for the facilitation of a specific molecule’s diffusion through the membrane. Active transporters require ATP to transport molecules while passive transporters don’t require ATP and transport molecules through non-energy processes such as diffusion through concentration gradients.
